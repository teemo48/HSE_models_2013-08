===================

### To Kate from TW:

HSE_models_2013-08 is a superset of the files in the zip I sent you for working on a new HSE model.

A (non-exhaustive) list of added files is below.  The links are to wiki pages associated with the files.


### TW R programs 

* HSE UK fit.r(../../wiki/Sidebar.md)    
   My rough but working "proof of concept" program to fit UK mesos with natural splines
   Also demonstrates fast execution of log-lik function by using matrix multiplication

### TW knitr programs and/or output

* HSE_Poisson_regression.Rnw   
   More complete description of HSE modeling with splines

[This is a crude link to a wiki page specifying .md](../../wiki/HSE_Poisson_regression.Rnw)
